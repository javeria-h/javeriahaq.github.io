To enhance the clarity and organization of our assignment, we have selected two literary works, namely "Pride and Prejudice" and "Emma" by Jane Austen which are available on Project Gutenberg. Our analysis is divided into three main sections. First, I will discuss "Pride and Prejudice," while Nikita will focus on "Emma." Finally, we will collaborate to compare and contrast our findings related to each corpus. Our goal is to present our individual perspectives in a clear and concise manner, while also fostering meaningful discussions to examine the similarities and differences between these two renowned works by Jane Austen. We believe that this structured approach will enable us to gain valuable insights and perspectives.

Before using Voyant Tools to analyze "Pride and Prejudice," I had the pleasure of reading the novel and gaining a comprehensive understanding of its plot and setting. The story revolves around Elizabeth Bennet, the protagonist, who embarks on a transformative journey of self-discovery and personal growth. Throughout the novel, Elizabeth learns valuable lessons about avoiding hasty judgments based on superficial characteristics, and recognizing the true nature of people beyond the surface-level. As she navigates through various situations that challenge her preconceived notions and prejudices, she gains a deeper understanding of human complexity and the importance of empathy in building genuine connections with others. Her journey of self-awareness and personal growth ultimately leads to her happiness and contentment in life, as well as in her relationships with those around her.

As I explored Voyant Tools, I came to the realization that simply reading a text in a linear fashion may not uncover all the insights that can be obtained from this tool. Voyant Tools offers a powerful means to analyze the frequency and distribution of words and phrases in a text which can help individuals to comprehend the central themes, motifs and character relationships without having to read the entire work. Moreover, Voyant Tools can aid individuals in identifying the most frequently used words and phrases, revealing the author's writing style and the linguistic techniques employed, which can enhance the appreciation of the work on a more technical level. Another valuable feature of Voyant Tools is its capacity to make connections between different characters and themes in the work. By examining the frequency of certain words and phrases in relation to specific characters or events, one can gain valuable insight into the development of characters and the progression of the plot, without necessarily having to read the entire text. The word cloud generated by Voyant Tools for Pride and Prejudice exemplifies this. The words "Elizabeth", "Darcy" and "Bennet" appear larger than other words in the cloud, highlighting the significance of these main characters in the story. Furthermore, the prominence of words such as "lady", "marriage", and "family" underscores the societal expectations and conventions of the time and the challenges that the characters confront in navigating them. The word cloud also reveals underlying themes and motifs of the novel, such as the importance of first impressions, the intricacies of romantic relationships and the value of family and community. 

In this section, I will provide a description of Jane Austen's novel "Emma". Like "Pride and Prejudice", "Emma" is a novel of manners set in Regency England. The story centers around the eponymous protagonist, Emma Woodhouse, a young woman from a wealthy family who lives in the village of Highbury. Emma is confident in her abilities as a matchmaker and believes she has a talent for reading people. However, her attempts at matchmaking often result in disastrous consequences. As the novel progresses, Emma begins to realize the error of her ways and learns important lessons about the consequences of meddling in the lives of others. Along the way, she also confronts the limitations of her own understanding and the dangers of making assumptions based on incomplete information. 


Upon analyzing the word cloud generated by Voyant Tools for the text of "Emma", we can see that the prominent words are "Emma", "mrs", "mr", "knightley", and "miss". These words indicate the significant characters of the novel, and their frequent use suggests their importance in the plot. The word 'good' is also relatively prominent in the cloud, which may indicate the characters' tendencies to evaluate each other's character and behavior. Additionally, the word cloud reveals other frequently used words like "Jane", "said", "woodhouse", "quite", "say", "Elton" and "know". These words can provide insights into the author's writing style, including her use of dialogue and the characters' way of speaking. The less prominent words like "hartfield", "dear", "frank", "wish", "young" and "thought" are indicative of minor plot elements and their infrequent use may suggest that they are not central to the overall storyline.

In terms of the text statistics, the vocabulary density is relatively low at 0.046, meaning that the author uses a limited range of words to tell the story. The readability index of 7.211 suggests that the novel is written at a relatively easy reading level, making it accessible to a wide range of readers. The average word per sentence of 19.3 indicates that the author tends to write longer sentences, which can make the text more complex.


The analysis of word clouds for both Pride and Prejudice and Emma using Voyant Tools revealed some similarities and differences. The most frequently used words in each book are the protagonists' names, Elizabeth and Emma, reflecting the author's style and consistency in her writing. Moreover, the vocabulary density, readability index and average words per sentence are similar for both novels, which is not surprising as they are written by the same author. However, the word clouds also highlighted some differences. Emma's word cloud shows a greater emphasis on the protagonist, while Pride and Prejudice has a more ensemble cast. The analysis also revealed different settings, with Pride and Prejudice set in the rural countryside, and Emma in the town of Highbury. This is reflected in the word clouds, with words related to the rural setting appearing more frequently in Pride and Prejudice, while words related to the town setting appear more frequently in Emma. The word clouds also reflect different themes and patterns. Pride and Prejudice focuses more on societal conventions and expectations, with prominent words related to social status and gender roles. In contrast, Emma emphasizes personal growth and development, with words related to personal qualities and character traits appearing more frequently.

After using Voyant Tools to analyze the texts "Pride and Prejudice" and "Emma", I realized that its effectiveness may be limited for texts in languages other than English. This is because the tool heavily relies on language-specific resources such as dictionaries, stop-word lists, and part-of-speech taggers, which may not be as readily available or comprehensive for less widely spoken languages. This lack of resources can impact the accuracy and usefulness of the analysis. Nonetheless, I found Voyant Tools to be an incredibly helpful tool for quickly analyzing lengthy texts.
